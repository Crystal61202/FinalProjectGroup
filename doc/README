At our first meeting, we started contacting each other through the school's Outlook email and assembled a group on Facebook's Messenger.
After that, we started making UML diagrams immediately.
We discussed and shared together to create links so that everyone could draw together after getting the UML diagram.
Of course, this is just a sketch, then we will edit it to be more perfect when submitting, just a sketch to come up with ideas.
We immediately start instantiating the necessary Classes and Methods that we have listed in the UML diagram.
Then Truong created Github and researched how to bring people together through Intellij.
After the meeting, everyone shared their work, such as Tri will be the GUI creator and Truong, Khang, and Vinh will research methods to meet the criteria.
And in the days that followed, we began to research methods to solve the problems that customers raised.
In the process of working, we found that Khang is the one who solves the most problems, so that he will be the one with the highest Contribution, then Tri, and then Truong and Vinh.
